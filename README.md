# velocileptors
Velocity-based LPT and EPT expansions of redshift-space distortions.

This code computes the real- and redshift-space power spectra and correlation functions
of biased tracers using 1-loop perturbation theory (with effective field theory
counter terms and a cubic biasing scheme).

The code requires numpy, scipy and pyFFTW (the python wrapper for FFTW):

https://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/

to run. Note that pyFFTW is pip installable and available from conda-forge.

An example calculation to reproduce the plots in the paper is given in Moment Expansion Example.ipynb.
A short notebook detailing the same steps for the Fourier Streaming Model is given in Fourier Streaming Model Example.ipynb.
Also included is Gaussian Streaming Model Example.ipynb that runs through how to produce the correlation function multipoles.


The core rsd modules are:

(1) moment_expansion_fftw.py: this computes redshift-space power spectra using the moment expansion approach.

(2) gaussian_streaming_model_fftw.py: this computes redshift-space correlation functions using the Gaussian streaming model.

(3) fourier_streaming_model_fftw.py: this computes redshift-space power spectra using the Fourier streaming model. 

All the rsd models use velocity spectra from velocity_moments_fftw.py, which itself inherits the real-space power spectrum module cleft_fftw.py.

All the above "physics" modules take in bias vectors given by 

bvec = [b1, b2, bs, alpha, alpha_v, alpha_s0, alpha_s2, sn, sv, s0]

where the parameters are:

(1) b1, b2, bs: the bias parameters up to quadratic order

(2) alpha, alpha_v, alpha_s0, alpha_s2: the one-loop counterterms for each velocity component

(3) sn, sv, s0: the stochastic contributions to the velocities




In addition there are a few supporting modules:

(1) qfuncfft.py: a class to compute LPT kernels using 1d-ffts

(2) spherical_bessel_transform.py and spherical_bessel_transform_fftw.py: two fftlog routines, one that uses fftw and the other numpy

(3) loginterp.py: a function for performing log-extrapolated interpolating functions.

This code is related to the configuration-space based code https://github.com/martinjameswhite/CLEFT_GSM.
