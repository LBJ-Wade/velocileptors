# velocileptors/LPT

The Lagrangian PT branch of the velocileptors code.

This code computes the real- and redshift-space power spectra and
correlation functions of biased tracers using 1-loop perturbation
theory (with effective field theory counter terms and up to cubic
biasing) as well as the real-space pairwise velocity moments.

For most situations computing the power spectrum wedges or multipoles
is as simple as:

```
from moment_expansion_fftw import MomentExpansion

mome        = MomentExpansion(klin,pklin,threads=nthreads)
kw,pkw      = mome.compute_redshift_space_power_at_mu(pars,f,mu,reduced=True)
kl,p0,p2,p4 = mome.compute_redshift_space_power_multipoles(pars,f,reduced=True)
```

The core rsd modules are:

(1) moment_expansion_fftw.py: this computes real- and redshift-space power
spectra using the moment expansion approach.

(2) gaussian_streaming_model_fftw.py: this computes real- and redshift-space
correlation functions using the Gaussian streaming model.

(3) fourier_streaming_model_fftw.py: this computes redshift-space
power spectra using the Fourier streaming model. 

All the models use velocity spectra from velocity_moments_fftw.py,
which itself inherits the real-space power spectrum module cleft_fftw.py.



For the most common case of computing the redshift-space power spectrum
one can use a a _reduced set_ of parameters:

pars = [b1,b2,bs,b3] +  [alpha0,alpha2,alpha4,alpha6] +  [sn,sn2,sn4]

where

(1) b1, b2, bs, b3:  the bias parameters up to cubic order

(2) alpha0,alpha2,alpha4,alpha6: counter terms of the form mu^n.

(3) sn, sn2, sn4: stochastic contributions to P_real(k), sigma^2
    [e.g. shot-noise and finger-of-god dispersion] and the fourth moment.

For many purposes you can set alpha6 and sn4 to zero.


If you additionally want access to the velocity statistics, then the
full set of parameters is

pars = [b1, b2, bs, b3] +  [alpha, alpha_v, alpha_s0, alpha_s2] +  [sn, sv, s0]

where the parameters are:

(1) b1, b2, bs, b3: the bias parameters up to cubic order

(2) alpha, alpha_v, alpha_s0, alpha_s2: the one-loop counterterms
for each velocity component

(3) sn, sv, s0: the stochastic contributions to the velocities

More details can be found in Chen, Vlah & White (2020).
